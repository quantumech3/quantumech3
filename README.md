#### POAM: Projected Off Axis Manipulation
I want to preface this codebase by saying that we started it as a hackathon project. We then came to a professor about it and turned it into a research project. That is why the codebase is messy. Additionally, we have a private branch that we are not allowed to show at this time. What you are about to see is an early prototype.
