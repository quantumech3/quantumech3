#### POAM: Projected Off Axis Manipulation
I want to preface this codebase by saying that we started it as a hackathon project. We then came to a professor about it and turned it into a research project. That is why the codebase is messy. Additionally, we have a private branch that we are not allowed to show at this time. What you are about to see is an early prototype.

### Personal projects
#### Ambulance Simulator (Won funniest hack at SBU Hacks 2022)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88d90448-a875-46ed-8f76-2c5f32b706cc)

https://devpost.com/software/ambulance-simulator
A game about an ambulance driver who forgot where the hospital is and needs to deliver his patient in a minute or the patient dies. You win by not running anyone over on the way. Easy.... right?

#### EMT Simulator (Won Best Game Dev at SBU Hacks 2024)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e0a0b0f-8c77-477f-9451-4803deac1311)
A game in virtual reality which simulates the experience of taking a patient, putting them on a stretcher, and hauling them into an ambulance. Easy.... right?

#### My personal website
https://quantumech3.github.io
Check it out! I am trying to get back into blogging and I hope to write about some interesting topics in the future. I recently discovered a programming language called Max which allows me to make my own realtime DSP algorithms while I am using them, rather then being compiled. I will probably be uploading some blogs about that once I get more familiar with it myself.

#### Other interests
I am currently working on an electronic music/rock instrumental album. I post the songs as I work on them and I make all the cover art myself in Blender. I like playing with visual and DSP algorithms to create art with them.

I also do photography and other stuff along those lines. I enjoy making/playing video games from time to time. My personality can be summarized on the first blog of my personal website, hopefully not fully summarized though since I hope I am a more interesting person then that!
