#### POAM: Projected Off Axis Manipulation
I want to preface this codebase by saying that we started it as a hackathon project. We then came to a professor about it and turned it into a research project. That is why the codebase is messy. Additionally, we have a private branch that we are not allowed to show at this time. What you are about to see is an early prototype.

#### Ambulance Simulator (Won funniest hack at SBU Hacks 2022)
https://devpost.com/software/ambulance-simulator
A game about an ambulance driver who forgot where the hospital is and needs to deliver his patient in a minute or the patient dies. You win by delivering the patient and not running anyone else over on the way. Easy.... right?

<!---
Upload both ambulance simulators or links to devpost + screenshot, sorting synth, algebra library, and polysnake visualizer, and screenshots since the codebases are not usable
